This placeholder reflection reiterates that workflow integration probes document
experiments, learning loops, constraints, and opportunities for tooling
improvements within Holberton IDE environments. The aim is to capture process
signals such as coordination friction, automation wins, and coverage gaps so
future contributors inherit context-rich narratives instead of starting from
scratch. This placeholder reflection reiterates that workflow integration probes
